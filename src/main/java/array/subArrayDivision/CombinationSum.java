      This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create an array dp of size target + 1, where dp[i]
      will store the number of combinations that add up to i. The base case is dp[0] = 1 since there is one way to make
      a sum of 0, which is using no elements.
      For each element num in nums, we iterate through i from num to target, and for each i, we add dp[i - num]
      to dp[i]. This is because if we can make a sum i - num with some combination, we can make a sum i by
      adding num to that combination.
      The time complexity of this algorithm is O(target * nums.length), and the space complexity is O(target).
